                                <p>Being on the plan was super useful in helping stay on track with my weightloss goals. The team was also willing to help switch our meals on request</p>

                                <p>First off it’s the customer service!!! It’s something we normally don’t get here in these parts and EasyHNF does it seamlessly, the exceptional service cascades down to them. Then the food, makes you wonder why you haven’t been eating that healthy all your life. It’s not boring and you can tell it was prepared in the most hygienic setting/way. I genuinely hope more people find this brand! They change your relationship with food.</p>

                                <p>My reason for buying a meal plan was to remove the stress of deciding what to eat. Buying a healthy meal plan was a welcome addition. I never liked the idea of couscous and bulgur as a meal, because they are uninteresting to eat, but the way you prepared it changed my mind</p>

                                <p>It was a great experience. I wish I had been more disciplined. I lost about 3kg and my bloating disappeared. The meal is delicious. I’ll definitely be returning, I’m hoping I could get a customized service this time.</p>
