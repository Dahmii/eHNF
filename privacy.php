                        <p>We acknowledge the trust vested in Easy Health, Nutrition & Fitness (EasyHNF) for the curation of your meal plans and recognize the importance of preserving the privacy and security of the personal data you provide to us. We're committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring the security of the personal information you entrust to us. Herein, we outline our thorough procedures for handling your information with the utmost care.</p>
                        <p><b>Note:</b> Please be aware that our privacy policy may undergo updates without prior notice. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically to stay informed about any changes.</p>

                        <h1 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</h1>
                        <p>We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, etc.) from you when you set up an account with EasyHNF. We may use this information to send you suggestions about promotions and offers based on your interest.</p>

                        <h1 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Use of Demographic and Profile Data</h1>
                        <p>We rely on personal information to fulfill your service requests effectively. You have the option to opt out of receiving marketing and promotional materials from us. Your personal data serves various purposes, including dispute resolution, problem troubleshooting, ensuring a safe service environment, fee collection, and gauging consumer interest in our offerings. We also use your personal information to keep you informed about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates. We customize your experience to align with your preferences and utilize the data to detect and prevent errors, fraud, and other unlawful activities. This is done in accordance with our terms and conditions and as communicated to you upon collection. In our ongoing efforts to enhance our products and services, we gather and analyze demographic and profile data to better understand user behavior on our website. Your IP address helps us diagnose server issues and administer our platform, while also providing valuable demographic insights. Periodically, we may invite you to participate in optional online surveys, which assist us in tailoring your site experience based on your interests and preferences.</p>

                        <h1 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Cookies</h1>
                        <p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information stored by a Web server on a Web browser so it can be later read back from that browser. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember information specific to a given user. EasyHNF places both permanent and temporary cookies in your computer's hard drive. EasyHNF cookies do not contain any of your personally identifiable information.</p>

                        <h1 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Sharing of personal information</h1>
                        <p>We may share personal information with our corporate entities and affiliates to help prevent identity theft, fraud, and other unlawful activities. Additionally, we may correlate related or multiple accounts to safeguard against misuse of our services, and to facilitate joint or co-branded services at your request, when provided by multiple corporate entities. However, these entities and affiliates are prohibited from marketing to you as a result of such sharing unless you explicitly opt in. We may disclose personal information if required by law or in good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes. This may include disclosing personal information to law enforcement agencies, third-party rights owners, or others in good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms or Privacy Policy, respond to claims of third-party rights violations, or protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public. In the event that EasyHNF or its affiliates undergo a merger or acquisition, some or all of your personal information may be shared with the acquiring entity. In such cases, the acquiring entity (or the new combined entity) will be required to adhere to this privacy policy regarding your personal information.</p>
